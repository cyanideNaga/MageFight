Rough Design for fighting game design - rogue
- Characters have hp, stamina/magic, and ult meter
- (if side-scroller) Ult and spells can be changed/equipped by taking from enemies/bosses 
- kicks, punches, power punches, air kicks, ducking, jumping, aiming up
- combos are 3-move to 7-move inputs chains
- combos have types/effects (if multiplayer, then types don't matter; if sidescroller,
	then types have weaknesses/resistances):
	- stagger/trip, bleed, burn, dowsed, electric (more?)
	- dowsed-electric relationship: dowsing moves are weak water attacks, but electric
		combos can only hit players that are dowsed; electric attacks are powerful and/or
		charges ult faster (maybe even crit?); once an elec combo happens, target needs to
		be dowsed again
- fighter types:
	- brutes: "slow and tanky", not much stamina/mag, long combos (just because long it 
		doesn't mean powerful, strong normal attacks
	- ninjas: "agile and fragile", lot of stam/mag, short and med combos, either extra jump 
		or can air-dash (cost stamina), suseptable to stagger and/or low hp, weak (but quick)
		normal attacks
	- mages: "normie class", vanilla balance
	- monks "combo masters", have combos of all lengths, can block by casting a barrier 
		costs mag\stam, the powerful combos can only be close quarters

Questions:
Q: Should stam/mag replenish over time or through fighting? or both? - rogue

Q: Get rid of ult idea? I say at least hold off until we know what kind of fighting game - rogue

Q: Need more or less combo and fighter types? - rogue
